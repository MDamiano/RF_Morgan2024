# Earth-like Characterization Yield Random Forest Model

Context, description of the dataset, and analysis are described in the paper [Morgan et al. 2024](LINK HERE)

To use the Random Forest model presented in the paper, Python is necessary as well as the following packages:

`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xlrd`

## Usage

Once the packages are installed, open a Python instance (it can be a script, a Jupiter Notebook, ipython etc.) and use the following commands to load the Random Forest:

`from morgan2024 import *`

`rf = RF_Morgan2024('BAND')`

These lines will work if the dataset file "Morgan2024_dataset.xls" is in the same folder as the python file "morgan2024.py". The 'BAND' parameter in the second line must be substituted with one of the following: 'VIS', 'NUV', or 'NIR'.

Once the Random Forest has been loaded, it will be possible to use it to simulate Earth-like characterization yield by using the following command:

`rf.sim(diameter, loc(contrast), throughput, iwa)`

Substitute the 'diameter' with the telescope diameter value, the 'log(contrast)' with the loarithm of the contrast ratio, the 'throughput' with the telescope throughput value, and 'iwa' with the inner working angle (IWA) value.

## Example

`In[1]: from morgan2024 import *`

`In[2]: rf = RF_Morgan2024('VIS')`

`In[3]: rf.sim(6, -10, 0.1, 20)`

`Out[4]: 13.29610730168751`
